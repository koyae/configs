On Windows, `menurc` should be `mklink`ed to the following locations:

* "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\.gimp-2.8\\menurc" (or wherever Git Bash is installed, assuming it is installed)
* "_cygwinDirectory_\\home\\userName\\.gimp-2.8\\menurc"
* "C:\\Program Files\\GIMP 2\_8\\etc\\gimp\\2.0\\menurc"

On Linux, it can be left where it is. If desired, it can also be presumably symlinked to:

* "/etc/gimp/2.0/menurc"
