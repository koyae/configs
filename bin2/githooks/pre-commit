# If there are any lines that have the string 'nocommit' (with any sort of
# casing e.g. 'NoComMIt', stop the commit-action from going through.
#
# This way, you can place `# NOCOMMIT` or `// NOCOMMIT` or similar at the end of
# lines that need to be in the worktree for testing and development, but which
# you don't actually want to commit accidentally.
#
# USAGE:
#
#     (A) Manually run `./pre-commit` against a branch with staged commit
#
#     (B) Place in .git/hooks (default) or wherever `git config core.hooksPath`
#     points for a given repo. If a pre-commit hook already exists, modify it
#     to execute everything in .git/hooks/pre-commit.d/ or whatever, assuming
#     that doesn't happen already, in which case just symlink this into there.
