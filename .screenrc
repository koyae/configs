# <screenprefix> then ctrlC creates a new task and immediately offers to rename it,
# clearing the preset name automatically to empty before prompting for a new one:
bind ^c eval screen "title ''" title
# <screenprefix> then shiftA clears the old title when renaming a task:
bind A eval "title ''" title

# <screenprefix> then Enter-key initiates copy-mode:
bind "" copy
# <screenprefix> then question-mark-key starts a reverse search:
bind "?" eval copy "stuff ?"
# <screenprefix> then l focuses right:
bind "l" focus right
# <screenprefix> then h focuses left:
bind "h" focus left
# <screenprefix> then j focuses down:
bind "j" focus down
# <screenprefix> then k focuses up:
bind "k" focus up

# ctrlA then shiftTab focuses previous pane:
bindkey "^A^[[Z" focus prev
# ^ it may be possible to get this to work with regular `bind` (it seems to
# work by default on Cygwin with no explicit binding at all, actually) but
# Ubuntu appears to have problems with it. There may be an .inputrc fix to this
# but the above works for now.

# ctrlA then Up-key enters copy-mode and moves the cursor up:
bindkey "^A^[OA" eval copy "stuff k"
# ctrlA then Left-key enters copy-mode and moves the cursor left:
bindkey "^A^[OC" eval copy "stuff h"
# ctrlA then Right-key enters copy-mode and moves the cursor right:
bindkey "^A^[OD" eval copy "stuff l"

# afford a full second's worth of time for the above bindings before they're
# sent as normal input:
maptimeout 1000

# ctrlL enters command-mode:
bindkey "^L" colon

# Home-key just goes to the begining of the line in copy mode (mark mode):
markkeys "\^=\201"
# End-key just goes to the end of the line in copy mode (mark mode):
markkeys "$=\205"

# If you are using a special TERM or require other specifics on this computer,
# set variables and do other work in this file, otherwise, it can be empty or
# absent:
